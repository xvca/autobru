# autobru

An ESP32-based automatic coffee brewing control system that interfaces with Bluetooth scales and Breville Dual Boiler espresso machines.

## Overview

autobru automatically monitors coffee shot weight using a Bluetooth-enabled BOOKOO scale and can stop the shot at a target weight by controlling the brew switch on a Breville Dual Boiler espresso machine.

## Features

- Connects to BOOKOO Bluetooth scales
- Reads real-time weight and flow rate data
- Battery level monitoring for connected scale
- Automated shot control based on target weight
- WebSocket-based real-time weight updates
- Asyncronous web server for control and monitoring
- RESTful API endpoints for scale control
- Future integration planned with bru coffee brewing/bean tracking PWA

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 development board 
- Breville Dual Boiler espresso machine
- BOOKOO Bluetooth coffee scale
- Basic wiring for brew switch control

## Dependencies

- [NimBLE-Arduino](https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino) - Lightweight Bluetooth LE library
- [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer) - Async HTTP and WebSocket server
- [AsyncTCP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP) - Async TCP library for ESP32

## Setup

1. Install PlatformIO IDE extension in VS Code
2. Clone this repository
3. Build and upload to your ESP32 using PlatformIO

## Configuration

The device will automatically:
1. Scan for BOOKOO scales
2. Connect when found
3. Begin receiving weight measurements
4. Start the web server for control and monitoring
5. Enable WebSocket connection for real-time data

## Web Interface

The ESP32 hosts a web interface accessible via its IP address, offering:
- Real-time weight display via WebSocket
- Scale control (tare, timer functions)
- RESTful API endpoints for automation

API Endpoints:
- `/weight` - Get current weight
- `/tare` - Tare the scale
- `/start-timer` - Start the timer
- `/stop-timer` - Stop the timer
- `/reset-timer` - Reset the timer
- `/start-and-tare` - Start timer and tare

## Status

This is currently a work in progress. Future updates will include:
- Integration with bru PWA
- Configurable target weights
- Remote control capabilities
- Web interface features
